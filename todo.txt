Lock the value somehow so in case of multithreading to make writes atomic

Add a way to disable the defun, so that it doesn't expand to include the timers (acts as normal defun for production code)

Add traversal for the times object and useful functions for it

Add testing files

Find a way to package/build

?? create elisp version?

?? create an actual object to depict time object instead of list

?? Shadow the actual "defun" function from common lisp package (dangerous?) or add a function that can be used to shadow the defun function if needed so that it can be applied to all functions
